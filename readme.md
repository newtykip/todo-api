### Why is this a thing?

newt wanted to practice typescript express api development alongside interfacing with newer technologies they have been learning that they do not have much experience with.

a very cliche and overdone project, but a fun one and a good one to demonstrate skill nonetheless.

a front-end may be coming eventually, who knows.
